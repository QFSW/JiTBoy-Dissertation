\subsection{Aims and Objectives}

The project aims to accelerate binary emulation beyond the speeds possible with traditional interpretation based emulators. The specific criteria by which this is judged will be explored further in \autoref{section:req-cap-performance}. This will be achieved by completing the following objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A traditional interpreter will be developed as a performance and functionality baseline.
    
    \item The JIT compiler based emulator will be developed in an effort to outperform the interpreter, demonstrating the viability of JIT compilation as technique for accelerating binary translation.
    
    \item The concurrent JIT-Intepreter hybrid emulator will be developed in an effort to mitigate the weakness of the JIT emulator and better utilise the multiple logical processors on modern systems.
\end{enumerate}
