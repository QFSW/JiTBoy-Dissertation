\subsection{Functionality}
\label{section:req-caps-functionality}

The emulators will be written with full functional correctness with respect to the subset of MIPS-1 defined earlier and with functional parity to the interpreter. This will be verified through comprehensive manual testing.

Test suites will be written for every instruction in the MIPS-1 ISA to ensure that the behaviour of the emulators are consistent with the behaviour described in the ISA. Furthermore, additional tests will be written to verify the behaviour of more complex constructs when specified by the ISA such as the branch delay slot.
