\subsection{Project Specification}

The project will consist of building a JIT based emulator, an interpreter and a JIT-Interpreter hybrid. The interpreter will serve as performance baseline for evaluating the JIT system. The hybrid system intends to combine the best aspects of the JIT and the interpreter systems.

The following criterion have been defined for the emulators:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Source Architecture}: MIPS-1
    
    MIPS-1 has been selected as the ISA for the source architecture as it is a simple ISA. \YIComment{Talk about emulating to the register/memory level.}

    None of the co-processors will be supported as they increase the complexity of the implementation without providing increased insight of value. This means no floating point operations will be supported.
    
    \item \textbf{Host Architecture}: x86
    
    x86 has been selected as the host ISA as it is the most frequently used ISA on modern desktop computers. This allows the project to demonstrate its potential use in a commercial product designed for x86 systems. x64 is not considered or supported at this time as it provides extra implementation complexity without providing evaluation results of extra interest.
    
    \item \textbf{Host System}: Windows 10
    \item \textbf{Emulator Input}: MIPS-1 binaries, MIPS-1 assembly
    \item \textbf{Microarchitecture Simulation}: None
\end{itemize}
