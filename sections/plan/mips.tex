\subsection{MIPS-1 ISA Coverage}

Currently, the \texttt{LWL} and \texttt{LWR} instructions are not implemented in either emulator. The branch delay slot is also not yet emulated. Support for these will give the emulators complete coverage of the base MIPS-1 ISA and will be completed by the end of February.
