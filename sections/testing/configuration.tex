\subsection{Configuration}

The test runner has been made configurable with the following options:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{timing}
    
    Various timing configurations used for performance benchmarking.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{precision}
        
        The precision used when measuring benchmark time. Benchmarks will be performed until the proportional error deviation is smaller the \texttt{precision}.

        \item \textbf{batch\_size}
        
        The number of times to run the test in a single benchmark. Used  for reducing timing inaccuracies.

        \item \textbf{threshold}
        
        The number of benchmarks that must occur, with the precision met, before the performance collection is complete. Used to reduce the probability of a random low error causing early termination.

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Further options will be developed as required.
