\subsection{Analysis}

The aggregated test statistics are then consumed by the analysis framework written in Python. In addition to generating all the graphs and analyses, it also calculates the following composite statistics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$\text{mips} = \frac{\text{source instructions emulated}}{\text{time}}$}
    
    Mega instructions per second (mips), not to be confused with MIPS! Defines the performance of a given test run in a quantity invariant of the duration of the test itself.

    \item \textbf{$\text{hotness} = \frac{\text{blocks executed}}{\text{blocks}}$}
    
    How frequently the compiled host blocks are executed on average, or how hot they are.

    \item \textbf{$\text{host block size} = \frac{\text{host instructions}}{\text{blocks}}$}
    
    Average block size in host instructions.

    \item \textbf{$\text{source block size} = \frac{\text{source instructions}}{\text{blocks}}$}

    Average number of source instructions represented by a single host block.

    \item \textbf{$\text{compilation inefficiency} = \frac{\text{host instructions}}{\text{source instructions}}$}
    
    Average number of host instructions required to translate a single source instruction.
    
    \item \textbf{$\text{execution inefficiency} = \frac{\text{host instructions executed}}{\text{source instructions emulated}}$}
    
    Average number of host instruction executions required to emulate a single source instruction.
\end{itemize}
