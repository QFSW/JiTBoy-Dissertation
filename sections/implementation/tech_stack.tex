\subsection{Technology Stack}

\YIComment{For JIT compiling, manual memory allocation with control over executable permissions is required; this eliminates all languages that cannot call OS functions such as JS}

\YIComment{Need to be able to invoke an arbitrary block of memory as a function pointer; eliminates all languages without sufficiently unsafe casting}

\YIComment{Must allow execution of binary code directly on the bare metal without any abstraction like a VM; no Java}

\YIComment{Need very high performance; lower level is better as it gives more granular control over each operation}

\YIComment{GC is bad for performance and potentially functionality issues, so no Haskell or C\#}

\YIComment{x86 calls native functions so need unmanaged function pointers}

\YIComment{Functional languages good for parsers or IR based optimisers but not for actual compiler and single proc solution is better than multiproc}

\YIComment{Talk about paradigms and code quality C++ \> C}

\YIComment{Python for analysis: performance doesn't matter, matplotlib is good, very strong scripting language with good community support}
