\subsection{Running JiTBoy}

JiTBoy can be run by executing \texttt{JiTBoy.exe} in a command line interface (CLI) such as \texttt{cmd}. The executable will be in either \texttt{Release} or \texttt{Debug} depending on which configuration the project was built with.

By default, JiTBoy will run all tests on all emulator configurations with no performance data collected. To collect performance data, provide one of the following \texttt{-{}-timing} arguments in \autoref{tbl:user-guide-timing}.

\begin{table}[H] 
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
        \toprule
        Argument & Configuration \\
        \midrule

        \texttt{-{}-timing=none} &
        \begin{tabular}{ll}
            \texttt{batch\_size} & 1 \\
            \texttt{threshold}   & 0 \\
            \texttt{precision}   & 1 \\
        \end{tabular} \\
        \midrule

        \texttt{-{}-timing=fast} &
        \begin{tabular}{ll}
            \texttt{batch\_size} & 1 \\
            \texttt{threshold}   & 2 \\
            \texttt{precision}   & 0.1 \\
        \end{tabular} \\
        \midrule

        \texttt{-{}-timing=accurate} &
        \begin{tabular}{ll}
            \texttt{batch\_size} & 10 \\
            \texttt{threshold}   & 10 \\
            \texttt{precision}   & 0.01 \\
        \end{tabular} \\
        \midrule

        \texttt{-{}-timing=final} &
        \begin{tabular}{ll}
            \texttt{batch\_size} & 100 \\
            \texttt{threshold}   & 10 \\
            \texttt{precision}   & 0.0001 \\
        \end{tabular} \\

        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Supported timing configurations for the test runner CLI.}
    \label{tbl:user-guide-timing}
\end{table}

JiTBoy can also be run on a single test with an emulator config of choice by using \texttt{-{}-single}; it is recommended to build with the \texttt{Debug} configuration for improved logging. To use \texttt{-{}-single}, invoke JiTBoy with the following format:

\texttt{JiTBoy.exe -{}-single test\_path emulator\_config}

\texttt{test\_path} must be a relative or absolute path to the test file desired. If a normal assembly file is provided, then no test validation will be performed. Emulator config must be one of the following emulators in \autoref{tbl:user-guide-single}. The emulator config is case insensitive.

\begin{table}[H] 
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
        \toprule
        Emulator & Argument Options \\
        \midrule

        \texttt{JIT} &
        \begin{tabular}{ll}
            \texttt{-L } & Enables direct linking \\
        \end{tabular} \\
        \midrule

        \texttt{Hybrid} &
        \begin{tabular}{ll}
            \texttt{-L}  & Enables direct linking \\
            \texttt{-S}  & Enables speculative compilation \\
            \texttt{-Tx} & Sets the compilation threshold to \texttt{x} \\
        \end{tabular} \\
        \midrule

        \texttt{Interpreter} &
        \begin{tabular}{ll}
            None & \\
        \end{tabular} \\

        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Supported emulator configurations for JiTBoy's \texttt{-{}-single} mode.}
    \label{tbl:user-guide-single}
\end{table}

For example, the following would invoke the test \texttt{long\_mul.s} under the JIT emulator with direct linking enabled:

\texttt{JiTBoy.exe -{}-single tests/mips/func/long\_mul.s JIT -L}
