Several papers have investigated utilising JIT compilation to accelerate binary emulation, otherwise known as dynamic binary translation (DBT). Mark Probst \cite{mark-probst-dbt} investigates a JIT-Interpreter hybrid to emulate foriegn binary programs. Unlike the hybrid model proposed, I will be exploring a concurrent architecture to exploit the multiple cores present on modern CPUs.
